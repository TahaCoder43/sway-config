# Setup

1. Install sway (Check out there website, or your distros website on how to do it)
2. `git clone https://github.com/TahaCoder43/sway-config.git /home/[USERNAME]/.config/sway` (depends on your $XDG_CONFIG_HOME I think)
3. Press Super+Shift+c (super is usually windows key)

# Suggestions

- add command mode and move not as used commands there, like add a gauth shower command, and a terminal password manager shower command, (maybe same as launcher mode)
- open websites in webview, and this should be in launcher mode
