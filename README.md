# Setup

1. Install sway (Check out there website, or your distros website on how to do it)
2. `git clone https://github.com/TahaCoder43/sway-config.git /home/[USERNAME]/.config/sway` (depends on your $XDG_CONFIG_HOME I think)
3. Press Super+Shift+c (super is usually windows key)

# Suggestions

- add command mode and move not as used commands there, like add a gauth shower command, and a terminal password manager shower command, (maybe same as launcher mode)
- open websites in webview, and this should be in launcher mode

## Roadmap

bring sway to your laptop harddrive

add shadows, blurs, transitions to sway, if not possible look at swayfx|hyperland (migrating to hyperland means rewriting sway configuration)

make a cool floating islands style topbar with help of waybar|yambar

make a cool startup widget panel, (like the ones built with eww), and use it to switch to multiple profiles, one for work, one for entertainment, gaming e.t.c

## Extras

eww|ags will allow you to add honeycomb desktop items, and a lot more cool stuff!
